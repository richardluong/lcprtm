Initialization:
    Initialize W1 and get token2id dictionary through gensim lda
    Initialize neural network with W1, W2 = ID matrix

Goal: to learn W1 and W2
    1) Choose one source sentence and its corresponding N-best list (preferably randomly)
    Estimate gradients for W1 and W2 with this training sample
